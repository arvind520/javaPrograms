/*Australia hasnâ€™t lost a Test Match at the Gabba since 1988. India has to win this one, but unfortunately all of their players 
are injured.

You are given the following information:
1. A total of N players are available, all are injured initially.
2. You have M magic pills. Using X pills, you can make any one player fit for match.
3. Alternatively, you can exchange any player for Y magic pills.

Compute the maximum number of players you can make fit for the Gabba Test Match.

Note: "Exchanging" a player means that player will no longer be available and you will gain Y extra magic pills for the exchange

Sample Input:-
5 10 2 1

Sample Output:-
5

Explanation:-
You can make all players fit if you use all the pills.

Sample Input:-
3 10 4 2

Sample Output:-
2

Explanation:-
You can make 2 players fit using the initial candies. Otherwise, Exchanging one player would result in a total of 10+2=12 
magic pills. This is enough to make 3 players fit, but you won't have 3 players remaining. */
